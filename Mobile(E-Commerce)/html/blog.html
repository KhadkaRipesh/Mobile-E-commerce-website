            <h2>EFFECT OF TECHNOLOGY</h2>

            <p style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 200px; text-align: justify;"> <span class="orange">Technology</span> can be a scary thing, especially for businesses that have found success doing things a certain way and are wary of changing their ways. Technology is also advancing at a rapid pace -- and sudden change is something that many people in general aren’t comfortable with. However, if you don’t keep up with new technology, you risk losing ground to your competition.</p>
            <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">POSITIVE IMPACTS OF TECHNOLOGY</h2>

                    <p>In the realm of science fiction, there are plenty of stories focused on technology that ends up having a sinister effect on humankind. And as technology continues to play a greater role in our work and personal lives, cautionary tales have arisen that remind us that even tools created with the best intentions can cause unexpected problems.
                    However, there’s no doubt technology has also added significant improvements in the lives of people around the globe, including recent, rapidly deployed health, workplace and commerce technologies.</p>

                    <p>Social media and mobile devices may lead to psychological and physical issues, such as eyestrain and difficulty focusing on important tasks. They may also contribute to more serious health conditions, such as depression. Children’s brains are still developing and may be more sensitive to the effects of technology and its overuse than adult brains.</p>
